# unit-2-2-assignment

Do the following in `main()`.

## Shopping
Write a program that asks the user for an item type to buy, a number of items and a weight (remember to think about what data type should be used for each one). The program should then print a sentence repeating this information in a sentence as shown in the sample run.

Sample run:
```
What type of item are you buying?
widgets
How many are you buying?
11
How much does each one weigh?
3.75
11 widgets at 3.75 pounds each will weigh 41.25 pounds total
```
Note: All the user input prompts need to match the sample run exactly to get full credit for this activity.

## Quote
Using only one `System.out.print` or `System.out.println` command, write a program that prints the following quote. Make sure to include the quotation marks (") in your output.
```
"That brain of mine is something more than merely mortal; as time will show."
Ada Lovelace
The first computer programmer
```

## Rabbit
Write the code to output:
```
(\(\
( - -)
((') (')
```
It may be easier to get the correct output if you copy/paste each line from the sample run above.
